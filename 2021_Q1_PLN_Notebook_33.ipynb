            "Referred to as the Shahenshah of Bollywood (in reference to his 1988 film Shahenshah), Sadi ka Mahanayak (Hindi for, \"Greatest actor of the century\"), Star of the Millennium, or Big B, he has since appeared in over 200 Indian films in a career spanning more than five decades, and has won numerous accolades in his career, including four National Film Awards as Best Actor, Dadasaheb Phalke Award as lifetime achievement award and many awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies.\n",
            "His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film Saat Hindustani, directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu and Jalal Agha.Anand (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna.\n",

            "The film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star.\n",
            "This led to Bachchan being dubbed as the \"angry young man\", a journalistic catchphrase which became a metaphor for the dormant rage, frustration, restlessness, sense of rebellion and anti-establishment disposition of an entire generation, prevalent in 1970s India.The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together: not only Zanjeer but also subsequent films such as Abhimaan, which was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office.\n",
            "His supporting role won him his second Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as Kunwara Baap and Dost, before playing a supporting role in Roti Kapda Aur Makaan.\n",
            "The other, released on 15 August 1975, was Sholay, which became the highest-grossing film ever in India at the time, in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev.\n",
            "Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film.\n",
            "In 1977, he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Amar Akbar Anthony, in which he played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves.\n",

            "After a three-year stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, Bachchan returned to films in 1988, playing the title role in Shahenshah, which was a box office success.\n",
            "He gained success during this period with the crime drama Aaj Ka Arjun (1990) and action crime drama Hum (1991), for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued.\n",
            "Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film, Shantaram, directed by Mira Nair and starring Hollywood actor Johnny Depp in the lead.\n",

        "example_text = '''Yamaha is reminding people that musical equipment cases are for musical equipment — not people — two weeks after fugitive auto titan Carlos Ghosn reportedly was smuggled out of Japan in one. In a tweet over the weekend, the Japanese musical equipment company said it was not naming any names, but noted there had been many recent stories about people getting into musical equipment cases. Yamaha (YAMCY) warned people not to get into, or let others get into, its cases to avoid \"unfortunate accidents.\" Multiple media outlets have reported that Ghosn managed to sneak through a Japanese airport to a private jet that whisked him out of the country by hiding in a large, black music equipment case with breathing holes drilled in the bottom. CNN Business has not independently confirmed those details of his escape. The former Nissan (NSANF) CEO had been out on bail awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing before making his stunning escape to Lebanon at the end of December. Ghosn has referred to his departure as an effort to \"escape injustice.\" In an interview with CNN\\'s Richard Quest last week, Ghosn did not comment on the nature of his escape, saying he didn\\'t want to endanger any of the people who aided in the operation. Ghosn did, however, respond to a question about what it felt like to ride through the airport in a packing case by first declining to comment but then adding: \"Freedom, no matter the way it happens, is always sweet.\" In a press conference in Lebanon ahead of the CNN interview last Wednesday, Ghosn\\'s first public appearance since fleeing Japan, Ghosn said he decided to leave the country because he believed he would not receive a fair trial, a claim Japanese authorities have disputed. Brands sometimes capitalize on their tangential relationship to big news in order to attract attention on social media. Yamaha is one of Japan\\'s best known brands and Ghosn was one of Japan\\'s top executives before being ousted from Nissan — a match made in social media heaven. Not surprisingly, Yamaha\\'s post went viral on Twitter over the weekend.'''"
